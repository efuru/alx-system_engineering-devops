What is a shell script?

A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a LINUX/UNIX-based operating system.

It is called a shell script because it combines a sequence of commands

that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script.


Shebang

The shebang line is ignored by the interpreter,

because the # character is a comment marker in many scripting languages
